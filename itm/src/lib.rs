//! # `itm`
//!
//! A decoder for the ITM and DWT packet protocol as specifed in the
//! [ARMv7-M architecture reference manual, Appendix
//! D4](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0403/ed/). Any
//! references in this code base refers to this document.
//!
//! Aside from covering the entirety of the protocol, this crate offers
//! two iterators which reads data from the given [`Read`](std::io::Read)
//! instance:
//!
//! - [`Singles`](Singles), which decodes each packet in the stream in sequence,
//! yielding [`TracePacket`](TracePacket)s.
//!
//! - [`Timestamps`](Timestamps), which continuously decodes packets
//! from the stream until a local timestamp is encountered, yielding a
//! [`TimestampedTracePackets`](TimestampedTracePackets), which contains
//! [a timestamp relative to target reset of when the packets where
//! generated target-side](TimestampedTracePackets::timestamp).
//!
//! Usage is simple:
//! ```
//! use itm::{Decoder, DecoderOptions};
//!
//! // or a std::fs::File, or anything else that implements std::io::Read
//! let stream: &[u8] = &[
//!     // ...
//! ];
//! let mut decoder = Decoder::<&[u8]>::new(stream, DecoderOptions { ignore_eof: false });
//! for packet in decoder.singles() {
//!     // ...
//! }
//! ```
